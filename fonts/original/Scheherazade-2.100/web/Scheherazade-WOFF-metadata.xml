        <text lang="en">
          Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights tale, 
          is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as Monotype Naskh, 
          extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
          
          The goal for this product is to provide a single Unicode-based font family
          that contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
          Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
          technologies to support complex typographic issues. 
          
          This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
          connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
          or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
          simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
          languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
          literate communities.
          
          Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
          
               * Scheherazade Regular
               * Scheherazade Bold
          
          This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 8.0 Arabic character 
          repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
          recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType 
          and Graphite technologies.
          
          For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.
