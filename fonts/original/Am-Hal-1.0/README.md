# Am Hal? - أم هل؟
Am-hal is a modern Arabic typeface designed by individuals as part of a workshop conducted by [Mohamed Gaber](http://kieftype.com) in the [Arab Digital Expression Foundation’s] (https://arabdigitalexpression.org/) 3rd Youth Camp. Every single letter was created by a different participant, and was digitized and developed by the participants under th guidance of Gaber.

The workshop, titled “Hurouf”, aimed to educate the audience about the importance of digital Arabic typefaces and the scarcity of open-source fonts online compared to the number of Arabic-speaking internet users. In the exercise, Gaber asked every participant to randomly choose an Arabic letter and draw it in all its positions in a word, without any pre-conceived limitations and considerations.

The final outcome of the typeface reflected the limitlessness of possibilities when it comes to Arabic fonts and reinforced type design as means of identity expression.
