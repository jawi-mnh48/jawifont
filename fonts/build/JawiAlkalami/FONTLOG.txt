FONTLOG
JawiAlkalami font
derived from Alkalami font
==========================

This file provides detailed information on the Alkalami font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Alkalami font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Alkalami is the local word for the Arabic "qalam", a type of sharpened stick used
for writing on wooden boards in the Kano region of Nigeria and in Niger, and what
gives the style its distinct appearance. The baseline stroke is very thick and
solid. The ascenders and other vertical strokes including the teeth are very
narrow when compared to the baseline. A generous line height is necessary to
allow for deep swashes and descenders, and the overall look of the page is a very
black, solid rectangle. Diacritics are much smaller in scale, with very little
distance from the main letters.

This font supports the characters known to be used by languages written with the
Kano style of Arabic script, but may not have the characters needed for other
languages.

This font utilizes state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
typographic issues. Font smarts are implemented using OpenType only. We have
no current plans to support Graphite.

Additional glyphs added and some glyphs modified by Yaya MNH48 to support
Jawi alphabet and Pegon alphabet. For more information, see
https://github.com/jawi-mnh48/jawifont/

For now, one font is included in this release:
     * JawiAlkalami Regular
